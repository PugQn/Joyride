# Joyride

Joyride (INFO101, Victoria University Wellington 2023)

This was an individual project. In response to the assessment provocation, I 
chose to brand my fictional company as "fun", "A Joy to Ride", which is 
reflected in the logo and colour palette. All information about the company is
fictional and is in no way meant to represent an existing company. This was my
first attempt at writing in JavaScript.

The assignment scenario was as follows (edited):

Project Introduction

Former university friends Wei Zhang (a mountain bike enthusiast) and Tory Kairua
(e-commerce expert) have decided to set up a company hiring out bicycles and 
scooters within the Wellington region. 
- Tory and Wei have electric, mountain and road bikes for hire along with
  e-scooters and monster scooters.
- They also provide safety helmets.
- They have set up bicycle racks near popular cycling locations within the
  Wellington region (e.g. Makara mountain bike park, Hutt river valley, Wellington
  harbor front) holding a range of bikes and scooters.
- Customers can
    - specify the vehicle they would like to hire,
    - how long they would like to hire it for and
    - where they would like to pick it up from.
- After payment they are given a code that they can use to unlock their selected
  scooter or bicycle.
- After the hire period is finished customers return the vehicle to the same
  bicycle rack.


Your Task for this Project

Develop a website for the company. This includes:
- the company name and appropriate branding,
- showcasing the services offered by the company, and
- creating the content, functions, and layout of the website.
  
The website should:
- Have a clear target audience and purpose.
- Have clear brand design and logo. 
- Be informative and offer clear insight into the company and its values.
- Be easily navigable by the user.
- Include a map.
- Be consistent (i.e., font, colour, and formatting) to give a comfortable user
  experience.
- Be consistent with the goals of the company.
- unique, which means that you’ll need to get creative.

You are expected to showcase the use of a variety of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website MUST contain the following FOUR html pages:
1. A home page – On this page you should write a brief “who we are” story (150
   words maximum) about the company and the company’s mission. Include company
   contact information on   this page. You need to make this up – be creative!
2. A services page - This page should display the range of bicycles and scooters
   available for hire. This page should include details of hire charges and the
   locations of pickup points.
3. A frequently asked questions (FAQ) page – It should show a list of answers to
   questions customers frequently ask, e.g., “What happens if the bicycle gets a
   flat tyre?”, “What if it starts to rain and my plans change?”, and “Am I covered
   by insurance if I have an accident” At the end of this page, you should add a
   form that enables customers to provide feedback to the company or ask any
   questions not addressed in the FAQ. Please remember to add your own questions
   in addition to those given here.
4. A registration and rental page – This page should contain four things:
    (i) A form that allows customers to register as a customer/create a site account
       and enter their details for future use.
    (ii) Customers should be able to enter address details including mobile phone
       contact details.
    (iii) Customers should be able to select the type of bicycle/scooter they want
       to hire, the period they want to hire it for and where they want to pick it
       up from.
    (iv) A form that permits customers to pay for vehicles they have rented via the
       website. Two or more functioning ‘buttons’ should be present (e.g., “register”
       and “pay now”), and they should each call a separate JavaScript function.
   
You are not expected to create fully functioning forms that can actually register people or take
payments, but the buttons should display the appropriate messages that indicate that a JS
function has been accurately used (for instance a correct result from a calculation operation
or a message such as, “Thank you for registering!”).
