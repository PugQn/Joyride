  <!--There is an issue here with the <aside> scrolling up as you reach the bottom of the page. I still haven't manaaged to figure out why it is doing this. It would have been easier if I just made the <aside> visible (fixed vs. sticky positioning) as the user lands on the home page but it didn't fit the asthetic I wanted. I feel the bikes and the logo is nice and clean but also makes it obvious what the company does.-->
